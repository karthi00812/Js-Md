`async` and `await` are keywords in JavaScript that are used to work with asynchronous code more efficiently, making it easier to read and write.

### `async` Keyword

The `async` keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. When a function is declared as `async`, it automatically returns a promise. This allows you to use `await` inside that function to pause the execution until the promise is resolved.

Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  // This function is asynchronous and returns a promise
  return "Data fetched";
}

fetchData().then(data => console.log(data)); // Output: Data fetched
```

### `await` Keyword

The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function. It pauses the execution of the `async` function and waits for the promise to resolve. Once the promise is resolved, it returns the result. If the promise is rejected, `await` throws an error.

Example:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  let data = await getDataFromAPI(); // Wait until the promise resolves
  console.log(data); // Output the data once it is resolved
}

fetchData();
```

### Example with `async` and `await` Together

Hereâ€™s a more detailed example showing how `async` and `await` can be used together to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable manner:

```javascript
// A function that returns a promise
function getDataFromAPI() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched from API");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

// An async function using await
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    let data = await getDataFromAPI(); // Waits for the promise to resolve
    console.log(data); // Outputs: Data fetched from API
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

### Benefits

- **Readability**: Asynchronous code written with `async` and `await` is generally easier to read and understand compared to using traditional promise chaining with `.then()` and `.catch()`.
- **Error Handling**: You can use `try` and `catch` blocks to handle errors in a more synchronous manner, making the code cleaner and easier to manage.

### Summary

- `async` functions return a promise.
- `await` is used to pause the execution of `async` functions until a promise is resolved.
- Together, they provide a cleaner and more readable way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript.
