In JavaScript, type coercion refers to the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another. This typically happens when you perform operations that involve different types of data. Here are some common types of coercion:

1. **String Coercion**: When you use the `+` operator with a string and another type, JavaScript converts the other type to a string.
   ```javascript
   let result = '5' + 1; // '51' (number 1 is coerced to string '1')
   ```

2. **Number Coercion**: When you use operators that expect numbers, such as `-`, `*`, `/`, or when you call functions like `Number()`, JavaScript converts strings and other types to numbers.
   ```javascript
   let result = '5' - 1; // 4 (string '5' is coerced to number 5)
   ```

3. **Boolean Coercion**: When a value is used in a context where a boolean is expected, such as in `if` statements or logical operations, JavaScript converts values to `true` or `false`.
   ```javascript
   if ('hello') {
       console.log('This is true'); // 'hello' is coerced to true
   }
   ```

4. **Object Coercion**: When you attempt to use an object in a context where a primitive value is expected, JavaScript converts the object to a primitive value using the `toString()` or `valueOf()` methods.
   ```javascript
   let obj = { value: 5 };
   console.log(obj + 1); // '[object Object]1' (object is coerced to string)
   ```

Type coercion can sometimes lead to unexpected results, so it's important to understand how JavaScript handles different types and conversions in various contexts.
